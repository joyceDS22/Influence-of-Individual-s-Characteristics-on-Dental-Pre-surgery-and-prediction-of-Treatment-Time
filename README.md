# Project Name: Influence of Individual’s Characteristics on Dental Pre-surgery and prediction of Treatment Time.

•	Main objective of the project is to analyse patient characteristics on their dental treatment plan.
•	Software Application: R Programming

•	Data Mining and Modelling is also required to extract from unstructured data information to structed data that is required to perform further analysis.
•	Sample Size is also performed to ensure the sample size is match against the rule of thumb.
•	Descriptive Statics is performed to analyse the frequency of the numerical dataset that is not too fat from a symmetrical shape.    
•	Data Analysis method: Principal Component Analysis is performed to prevent overfitting of the regression analysis model. After (PCA), Multiple Regression Analysis is analysed against the (P< 0.05). These are variables that significant effect of the (pre-surgery time).

•	Multiple Linear Regression Assumptions was also performed to ensure that it did not violate homoscedasticity, Normal QQ plot was not far away from the quantities of the residuals and theoretical quantise of the left side of the distribution.

•	Prediction of treatment using patient dental profile was analyse using Decision Tree, to further analyse which are the variables that are more likely to have a prolonged treatment time. The results shown that individuals who perform one tooth extraction is more likely to received shorter duration while patients who perform skeletal AP is more likely to receive longer treatment duration.

•	Learning outcome:
This project provided practical experience in using R Programming for decision tree analysis and multiple regression. It also helped in understanding the importance of patient characteristics in predicting treatment time and guiding early dental pre-surgery interventions. The findings highlighted how specific factors can impact the duration of dental procedures, which is valuable for both treatment planning and resource allocation.
